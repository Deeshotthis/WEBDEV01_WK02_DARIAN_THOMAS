                My Name is Darian Thomas. I am from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I am motivated to get out of school to start making money. My strengths are that I communicate well with others. My weakness is that I tend to lose focus when I’m not motivated. I work well with computers and I also love to work with cameras.

                Honestly just to get something out of life because at this moment I really just trying to get a degree behind myself. I am very serious about this because I’m trying to waste my money again like I did the first time. I would be the best candidate for the job because once I start something I feel like it is a must that I finish it.
